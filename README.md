A very simple 2048 game just using simple function and list
It is a challeging and fun prgramme for python beginner, the source code may not be the best way to code a 2048 game but it should be simple
You can figure out your own way to code the game

## Knowlegde requirement:
- simple function (using def)
- simple list ( list = [1,2,3] )
- random module ( import random )
- logic checking ( if / else )
- iterations ( for / while )

## Time Requiremet;
- 2-4 hours to learn the concepts
- < 4 hours to code
- Total: < 8 hours

You may learn most of the concepts from the best coding website for beginner [w3schoold](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)

## Guideline:
1. **Learn all the concepts from w3school**

  Check w3school and know all the basic syntax first, then simply learn the concept while doing the coding

2. **Understand the game**

Play the [game](https://play2048.co/) first to know about the rules and start planning for all the game set up and game rules

3. **Checkout the expected outcome**

Download the sourcecode and run it on your terminal, check out the expected outcome and start your coding :computer:

4. Always use source code for help

Some of the debugging may be annoying, check if the source code has the solution to your bug and help me to find my bugs too :rofl:
